## 1. Sword and Shield 
    'SwordShield.java' is a program that prints ascii sword and shield still lifes. Both the sword and shield still lifes were made by me. It is important to note that the getSword(),getShield(),getUnixTerminalWidth(), and getTerminalWidth() methods were originally made by Ms. Feng. The getSword() and getShield() were originally the getBunny() that was repurposed and renamed for this project, with the ascii art being changed to mine. I made no changes to getUnixTerminalWidth() and getTerminalWidth().(Citation points: 2,2,2,2)
